git clone --branch js-docker https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-AZ-104-Microsoft-Azure-Administrator.git ./js-docker
Change the directory to js-docker:

cd js-docker/
Build and push the image to Azure Container Registry using ACR Tasks and the Dockerfile provided (<IMAGE_NAME> can be anything you like e.g. js-docker:v1):

az acr build --image <IMAGE_NAME> --registry $ACR --file Dockerfile .
In the Azure portal, refresh All resources to view the newly created container registry with the js-docker repository and image.
